            <h3>Early Years</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I was born in the United Arab Emirates on May 3rd, 2004; and lived there for 10 years before moving to Canada. Both my parents were born and raised in Syria 
                before moving to the U.A.E. a couple of years before I was born. When I was younger, I played a lot of sports, mainly soccer, and did karate and got my 
                international black belt. When we moved to Canada we first lived with my uncle and aunt in Scarborough, for a year and a half before we moved to Pickering, 
                where I finished both elementary and high school.

            <h3>Present</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I am now 19 years old and am currently going to university at Toronto Metropolitan University. I am majoring in computer science and am currently in my second 
                year. On October 4th I am going on a long-deserved vacation to the Dominican Republic with two of my closest friends. On Thursdays I go to drop in volleyball in 
                the RAC and I am in intramural soccer with one of my friends with the games happening every Thursday.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                My hobbies as of late has been going to the gym and playing sports. I have been going to the gym for years and it's been a hobby that I've enjoyed ever since I 
                started. For sports, I enjoy playing almost any sports, but my favorites are soccer and volleyball. I used to play for a representative soccer team but stopped 
                to focus on school once I started high school. Volleyball has been a new sport I've began indulging in and it quickly rose to one of my favourites.
