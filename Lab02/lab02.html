                I was born in the United Arab Emirates on May 3rd, 2004; and lived there for 10 years before moving to
                Canada. Both my parents were born and raised in Syria
                before moving to the U.A.E. a couple of years before I was born. When I was younger, I played a lot of
                sports, mainly soccer, and did karate and got my
                international black belt. When we moved to Canada we first lived with my uncle and aunt in Scarborough,
                for a year and a half before we moved to Pickering,
                where I finished both elementary and high school.

            <h3>Present</h3>
            <p>
                I am now 19 years old and am currently going to university at Toronto Metropolitan University. I am
                majoring in computer science and am currently in my second
                year. On October 4th I am going on a long-deserved vacation to the Dominican Republic with two of my
                closest friends. On Thursdays I go to drop in volleyball in
                the RAC and I am in intramural soccer with one of my friends with the games happening every Thursday.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                My hobbies as of late has been going to the gym and playing sports. I have been going to the gym for
                years and it's been a hobby that I've enjoyed ever since I
                started. For sports, I enjoy playing almost any sports, but my favorites are soccer and volleyball. I
                used to play for a representative soccer team but stopped
                to focus on school once I started high school. Volleyball has been a new sport I've began indulging in
                and it quickly rose to one of my favourites.
