                    Baltimore, city, north-central Maryland, U.S., about 40 miles (65 km) northeast of Washington, 
                    D.C. It lies at the head of the Patapsco River estuary, 15 miles (25 km) above Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore is Maryland’s largest 
                    city and economic centre and constitutes the northeastern hub of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. The city, separated from Baltimore 
                    county in 1851, is the only city in Maryland not located within a county.

                    Baltimore was established in 1729 and named for the Irish barony of Baltimore. It was created as a port for shipping tobacco and grain, and soon local 
                    waterways were being harnessed for flour milling. At the outbreak of the American Revolution, it was a bustling seaport and shipbuilding centre. 
                    Baltimore clippers plied the seas, and trade extended to the Caribbean. The U.S. Navy’s 
                    first ship, the Constellation, was launched in Baltimore in 1797, and its namesake, the last all-sail warship built (1854) for the navy, has been moored 
                    in the city’s harbour since 1955; in the late 1990s the ship underwent extensive restoration.

                Baltimore is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maryland. Baltimore was designated an independent city by the Constitution of Maryland in 1851, and 
                today it is the most populous independent city in the nation.

                the harbor to 480 feet (150 m) in the northwest corner near Pimlico. The land that is now Baltimore was used as hunting ground by Paleo-Indians. In the early 1600s, the Susquehannock began to hunt there. People from the Province 
                of Maryland established the Port of Baltimore in 1706 to support the tobacco trade with Europe, and established the Town of Baltimore in 1729.

                Many of Baltimore's neighborhoods have rich histories. The city is home to some of the earliest National Register Historic Districts in the nation, including 
                Fell's Point, Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon. These were added to the National Register between 1969 and 1971, soon after historic preservation legislation was 
                passed. Baltimore has more public statues and monuments per capita than any other city in the country.

                Baltimore is in north-central Maryland on the Patapsco River close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay. The city is also located on the fall line between
                 the Piedmont Plateau and the Atlantic coastal plain, which divides Baltimore into "lower city" and "upper city". The city's elevation ranges from sea level at

                    One of America's foremost historic sites sits just three miles southeast of the city center. Fort McHenry, built between 1798 and 1803 to command the harbor entrance, 
                    is revered as the place that inspired the National Anthem, The Star Spangled Banner. In the fort's visitor center are displays and a film on the history of the fort, 
                    and you can tour the casemates and grounds to learn about the fort and its history through ranger talks and living history demonstrations. The original of the famous 
                    flag now hangs in the Museum of American History in Washington, DC.

                    In a city with more than its share of excellent museums, The Walters Art Museum, located in the Mount Vernon Cultural District, is a standout. This internationally 
                    renowned institution is one of only a few museums worldwide to present a comprehensive history of art from the third millennium BC to the early 20th century. Among its 
                    thousands of treasures are a fine collection of ivories, jewelry, enamels, and bronzes, and a large reserve of illuminated manuscripts and rare books. The Walters' Egyptian, 
                    Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ethiopian, and western medieval art collections are extensive, as are the museum's holdings of Renaissance and Asian art.

                    The most frequently visited attraction in Baltimore is the National Aquarium, in a striking building overlooking the Inner harbor. Exhibits in this huge complex explore Atlantic

                    Of particular note is the Tropical Rain Forest, a complete environment five stories high, where visitors can tour from the forest floor to the treetop canopy and see all kinds of 
                    birds, frogs, and a variety of larger mammals, such as sloths and monkeys. Elsewhere, visitors meet sharks and dolphins and the hundreds of exotic species found in the Atlantic

                    Baltimore's most unusual art museum by far is the American Visionary Art Museum, which displays the work of self-taught artists from around the world. This is not just a gallery 
                    of paintings and drawings, but a lively – and frequently changing – celebration of the creative spirit. Exhibits could include sculptures made from toothpicks, fabric collages, 
                    intricate embroidery, costumes created for a neighborhood festival, folk art from around the world, or art by people who are incarcerated. The exhibits all have an exuberance 
                    that is contagious, and there is always something thought provoking.
