        <h1>Part A</h1>
        <p>
            For the first part I used CSS media queries and viewport to implement a fluid response for three different breakpoints. I found the use of media queries very useful.
            The fact that I can chose the column sizes and alter them as I see fit was very nice. I liked the fact that I could change with the classes based on the viewport
            Making the page more responsive was fairly straight forward, thoough having to build each column and row separatly was a little bit of a hassle however it helped me 
            understand what each part was doing and made me feel more in control of what I was changing.

            For the second part I using the bootstrap framework. Although it was simpler to use I do not like it as much as the media queries. Its nice that everything is set up
            and that it is simpler but with the media queries I felt like I had more options customizing the responeses to my liking. Although I believe I was not using bootstrap
            to the best of its ability I still favoured the use of media queries over the bootstrap.
