# Recreational-Club-Membership

Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to Recreation House!

This program provides an easy-to-use platform for club managers and members to sign up, make payments, and schedule their preferred activities. Both user types can create accounts, with club managers gaining access to tools that track member registrations, payment statuses, and the overall financial standing of club events. Members can register for activities and complete transactions seamlessly. The system also includes automated reminder notifications to keep everyone informed of important updates. Additionally, a built-in messaging feature enables users to communicate directly within the platform.
